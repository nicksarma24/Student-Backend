How to run the Project:

First clone the Backend and Frontend repositories
then got to terminal:
cd Backend and cd Frontend
npi i

npi i will install all the dependencies 

Then in both the terminals do 
npm start 

on port 5000 backend server will run 
and on port 3000 brower will run and that's it

Thanks
